  The sqly_migrations table is stored with the "sqly_" prefix so it is out of the way of
  other applications. (Some databases don't support schemas.) Each migration is stored
  entirely in the database, so that (for example) the database can be migrated down even
  if we're on a git branch where some migrations don't exist in the code.
